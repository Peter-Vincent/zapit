# Zapit Tests

This directory contains software tests.
It should not be added to the MATLAB path.
Some tests are automated and run with MATLAB's testing framework.
Other tests are more interactive and are used for development or troubleshooting.

The `TestCamera` class is not really a test, just a minimal example of how to work with the `zapit.hardware.camera` class.
