# Stim Presenter Examples

Classes in this folder demonstrate how to present photostimulation waveforms using NI DAQmx.
These examples are aimed at developers wishing to implement this aspect of the code in a different programming language.
For Python you do not need to do this: you can `pip install zapit-python-bridge` and communicate with Zapit directly.
